# Push Readiness Messaging (High-Confidence, Evidence-Backed)

This guide replaces risky "no risks, no regressions" claims with verifiable, high-confidence language. Only use the messaging below after real checks have run and evidence is captured.

## Recommended Announcement (Codex Style)

> Confirming Version 4 is ready to push.
> Core Tier-1 foundation is complete: API logic and tool-catalog scaffolding are stable, consistent, and designed to scale.
>
> **Verification Status (High Confidence):**
> - No known regressions from Version 3 based on: lint/build pass, smoke routes, and catalog validation checks.
> - API responses are schema-consistent and catalog rules are enforced (no "fake success" outputs).
> - Tool catalog is structured for forward extension (new tools, new policies, new workflows) without refactors.
>
> **Next Steps**
> 1. Push Version 4 (Tier-1 foundation shipped).
> 2. Freeze Backend Detection Logic (baseline locked; changes require explicit PR + tests).
> 3. Choose next focus:
>    - Operation Envelopes (standardized inspect/execute results + audit trail)
>    - USB Passive Memory Layer (device expertise + USB awareness)
>    - Frontend Catalog Wiring (UI consumes truth-table API)
>
> Target lock: confirm the next focus and we proceed immediately.

### Why this language
- It anchors confidence to explicit checks instead of blanket "no risk" claims.
- It calls out the next focus so the team can sequence work without rewriting later.
- It keeps the release narrative consistent with truth-first rules (no fabricated success).

## Verification Gates to Cite
Use the commands and smoke calls you actually ran. Examples for this repo:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test` (or a narrower `npm run test:unit` / `npm run test:integration` if that is what you executed)
- `npm run build`
- Two smoke calls: one to the catalog endpoint and one to a safe inspect endpoint, verifying response schema
- Catalog load check: ensure every tool entry has ID, name, version, permissions

Document outputs (or attach logs) so "high confidence" is evidence-backed.

## Next Focus Recommendation: Operation Envelopes
Building a single response contract for inspect/execute/simulate/policy-deny keeps downstream wiring simple and prevents double work in the UI. Implement envelopes first so frontend and plugin authors target a stable shape from day one.
