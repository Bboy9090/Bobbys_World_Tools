Bobby’s Secret Workshop

A layered repair environment inspired by a real apartment workshop

Bobby’s Secret Workshop is built like a 90s apartment repair spot:
	•	Clean, professional shop up front
	•	Deeper rooms behind
	•	Trapdoors only where earned

Same engine as Reforge OS.
Different access philosophy.

🏠 Apartment Structure

Front Room (Public-Facing)
	•	Diagnostics
	•	Repairs
	•	Recovery
	•	Proof-based workflows
	•	Customer-safe operations

Back Rooms (Restricted)
	•	Advanced routing
	•	Deeper system states
	•	Manual confirmations

Trap Zones (Local-Only)
	•	Context-locked
	•	Not exposed
	•	Not advertised

If it can’t be justified up top, it stays below.

⸻

📚 Codex Rooms
	•	🎵 Sonic Codex — audio & signal intelligence
	•	👻 Ghost Codex — metadata hygiene & identity shielding
	•	⚡ Pandora Codex — hardware state research & routing

Codex rooms observe and classify.
Execution is always deliberate.
